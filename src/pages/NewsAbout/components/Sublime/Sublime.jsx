              More than 500 protesters, including 69 children, have been killed,
              according to the Human Rights Activists' News Agency (HRANA). Two
              protesters have been executed and at least 26 others face the same
              fate, after what Amnesty International calls "sham trials".

              Although nationwide demonstrations have swept Iran before - once
              in 2017 lasting until early 2018, and another in November 2019 -
              the current protests are unique, as they involve people from
              across society and women are taking a lead role under the slogan

              Taraneh Alidoosti, a well-known Iranian actress, is being held in
              the notorious Evin prison after she condemned the execution of a
              young protester. Previously, she published a photo of herself
              without a mandatory headscarf, holding a sign with the protesters'
              slogan.

              opposition to the unjust sentences being issued," Asghar Farhadi,
              who directed Alidoosti in his Oscar-winning film The Salesman,
              wrote on Instagram.
